To add a custom sound to your car download the files from gta 5 mods addons only add them the same way we have

go to the vehicles.meta find       <audioNameHash>baller</audioNameHash>

replace the name for the auido to the name of the file 

so it will be something like this 
<audioNameHash>r35sound</audioNameHash>

any feed back would be fab
